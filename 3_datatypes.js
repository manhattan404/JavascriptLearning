// Strings, Numbers, Booleans, Null , undefined, Symbol
//These are PRIMITIVE data types

const name = 'John';  //this is a string  // semicolons are not mandatory but its mostly used
const age = 30; //notice there are no quotation marks
const isCool = true; //also no quotation because it will be a string if you did
const rating = 4.5; //decimal, in JS, there are no floats
const x = null; //its a variable but its empty //this will print 'object' but it's bogus because it's really an object, ITS NULL!
const y = undefined; 
let z; //z has no value so it means its also undefined

console.log(typeof name); //this will print the type of data of the variable 'name' which is a string
